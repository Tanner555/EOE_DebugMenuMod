# EOE_DebugMenuMod

A Simple UI That Adds Debugging Functionality Into Edge of Eternity. It's still in early progress, I plan to add more features in the future. 

To Toggle the Debug Menu, Press the 'K' Key. 

You can find the Debug Menu on [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1594606336).

## Installation Guide
Installing the Mod Is Quite Easy. 
* You'll Need To Visit The Releases Page Here: [EOE Debug Menu Releases](https://github.com/Tanner555/EOE_DebugMenuMod/releases).
* Download the Latest Version, titled 'eoe_debug_menu_mod', and contains the zip. 
* Unzip the downloaded file into the SAME FOLDER. For instance, the zip could say Extract To "eoe_debug_menu_mod/". 
That way the folder structure will remain the same.
* Go into your Edge of Eternity Root Game Folder. You can do this by right clicking on EOE on steam, click properties, 
Go Into Local Files, and then click Browse Local Files...
* In the EOE root game file, navigate to "Edge Of Eternity/EdgeOfEternity_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods".
* Move the Folder you unzipped (It should have the same name as the zipped file) into the Mods Folder.
* You should now see the mod in the Mod Menu when you launch the game.
